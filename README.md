# Ballerina Contributors Guide

This repository contains helpful tips for anyone looking to start contributing to the Ballerina open-source project. When I first became interested in contributing to Ballerina, I struggled to find certain information, so I created this repo to share what I’ve learned along the way. While these tips may seem simple, I hope they will be valuable to others on their journey to becoming Ballerina contributors.

Please note that I’m still at the beginning of my own journey, and I’ll be continuously adding more tips as I learn.
